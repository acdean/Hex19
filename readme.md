Q14. HEX 19 [6 points]

Nathaniel lives on a small island. One weekend, after a barbecue,
he decides to go for a random stroll, starting from his home hex
(shown in green).
On each ‘step’ of the stroll, Nathaniel randomly selects the next hex
to visit from those adjacent to his current hex, with each option being
equally likely. (Any adjacent hex may be chosen - even one he has
previously visited.) If Nathaniel’s stroll lasts for a total of
19 steps, what is his most likely final location?

This code does one walk per frame and generates a heat-map of the end points.
